140          m4a        audio only  audio
137+140      mp4        1080p       video + audio (merge)
...

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Tips:

Always choose a merged format code like 137+140 to get both video and audio.

If you choose a video-only format (e.g., 137), the output will not have audio.

Make sure ffmpeg is installed correctly. The tool auto-installs it if missing.
